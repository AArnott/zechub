### Welcome to ZecWeekly

Hi Zcashers, it's been a tumultuous week! We've had a discussion with the Monero Community, stablecoins lost their peg to the dollar, ZecHub hosts a banner contest and a proposal made for implementing a Zcash Posterity Fund.

If you would like to make next weeks newsletter, head over to our [site](https://wiki.zechub.xyz/zecweekly-newsletter). We'll be happy to guide you through the process, it's a great way to learn about the ecosystem and earn ZEC.
