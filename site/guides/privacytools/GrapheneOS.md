<h2>**GrapheneOS Introduction**</h2>
GrapheneOS is a non-profit, open-source project dedicated to enhancing privacy and security on mobile devices while maintaining compatibility with Android apps. This Operating system places a strong emphasis on advancing privacy and security technologies, with a particular focus on bolstering sandboxing, exploit mitigations, and refining the permission model. Born in 2014 under the moniker "CopperheadOS," it has since evolved into the formidable guardian of your digital privacy and security.

GrapheneOS is dedicated to an all-encompassing approach to enhance the privacy and security of the operating system. It employs cutting-edge technologies to effectively reduce the risk of various vulnerabilities, making it significantly harder for malicious actors to exploit common sources of weaknesses. This heightened security extends not only to the core OS but also to the applications running on it.

One of GrapheneOS's primary objectives is to reinforce the security boundaries, such as the app sandbox, without adversely affecting the user experience. Whenever possible, these privacy and security features are seamlessly integrated, ensuring they operate without any noticeable impact or the need for additional user configuration.

However, achieving this balance can be challenging. Therefore, GrapheneOS may introduce various toggles for specific features, such as Network permissions, Sensors permissions, or restrictions when the device is locked (covering aspects like USB peripherals, camera access, and quick tiles). Additionally, more intricate user-facing privacy and security features are thoughtfully designed to maintain a user-friendly experience, each with its own user interface enhancements.

**Brief History of GrapheneOS**

In late 2014, GrapheneOS emerged under the visionary leadership of Daniel Micay. Initially conceived as a solo endeavor, it drew upon his prior contributions to open-source projects focused on privacy and security. The project's early stages saw the creation of an Android's Bionic libc port for OpenBSD malloc and the integration of the PaX kernel patches into the kernels compatible with the supported devices.

However, GrapheneOS quickly evolved beyond these initial ports, encompassing an extensive array of in-house privacy and security enhancements, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the core components, including the compiler toolchain and Bionic. Simultaneously, efforts were initiated to incorporate code into AOSP and various upstream projects. A remarkable feat of this period was the successful integration of a substantial portion of these early changes into upstream projects or influencing their subsequent replacements. During these formative days, GrapheneOS operated at a rapid pace, primarily because there existed numerous opportunities for immediate improvement. The project's focus was not yet centered on producing a highly robust, production-quality OS, but rather on addressing the readily available low-hanging fruit in the realm of privacy and security.

In 2015, a company became the main sponsor of GrapheneOS, originally known as [CopperheadOS](https://grapheneos.org/history/copperheados). Their goal was to build a business around the project by offering support, contract work, and customized proprietary versions of the OS. The understanding was that the company would support the open-source project, with GrapheneOS remaining independently owned and controlled by Daniel Micay. However, the company didn't fulfill its promises and is no longer affiliated with GrapheneOS. Their involvement ended up impeding the open-source project rather than benefiting it.

Fast forward to 2018, the company was hijacked by the CEO who attempted to take over the project through coercion, but they were rebuked. They seized the infrastructure and stole the donations, but the project successfully moved on without them and has been fully revived. Since then, they've taken to fraudulently claiming ownership and authorship of GrapheneOS work, which has no basis in fact. They've tried to retroactively change the terms of their involvement and rewrite the history of the project. These claims are easily disproven through the public record and by people involved with the open source project and the former sponsor. This former sponsor has engaged in a campaign of misinformation and harassment of contributors to the project. Be aware that they are actively trying to sabotage GrapheneOS and are engaging in many forms of attacks against the project, the developers, contributors and supporters. Meanwhile, they continue profiting from GrapheneOS open source work which they falsely claim as their own creation.

Today, GrapheneOS is supported by multiple full-time and part-time developers, along with contributions from various companies collaborating with the project. In 2023, the GrapheneOS Foundation was established as a non-profit organization in Canada to facilitate the collection and distribution of donations, ensuring the project's sustainability and independence.
