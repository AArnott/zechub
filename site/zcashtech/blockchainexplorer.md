# Blockchain Explorers

## Intro

In the traditional business world every transaction includes a reciept for proof of purchase. Similary, in the blockchain world a user would recieve a digital reciept in the form of a transaction id for every transaction completed.

  Some examples:
  
    * Bitcoin: `c839b44a7052393f4672cdc4ec79f8f15d3036565e13bede0fab91f674506a7c`
    
    
    * Ethereum: `0x43117fc201f8d3c09a72d42ab4a048003f348917771b9ace64b8944a91807320`
    
    
    * Zcash: `19a4be270089490ece2e5fe7a6c9b9804af3c7ed43e1fb1b744b0fb29070fa5d` or 
    
              `8dd212847a97c5eb9cee5e7e58c4d9e739f4156273ae3b2da1a4ff79ad95ff82`

Notice with zcash how one of those transaction id's has all important details hidden, this is important! Notice also how each chain as its own version of blockchain explorer. So we have this long string of charactors as a digital reciept, now what? This is where we will use our blockchain explorer, or map, to help us digest what happen on the blockchain.
