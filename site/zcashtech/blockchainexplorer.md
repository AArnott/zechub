# Blockchain Explorers

## Intro

In the traditional business world every transaction includes a reciept for proof of purchase. Similary, in the blockchain world a user recieves a digital reciept in the form of a transaction id for every transaction completed. Most wallets will provide this for you after completing some transaction.

## Blockchain explorers

So we have this long string of charactors as a digital reciept, what now? This is where we use our blockchain explorer, or map, to help us digest what happened on the blockchain. Notice how each chain as its own version of blockchain explorer above. Its important to understand that all these blockchain projects are examples of open source software. That is, anyone can contribute to and or fork the code to their liking.
