# Blockchain Explorers

## Intro

In the traditional business world every transaction includes a reciept for proof of purchase. Similary, in the blockchain world a user recieves a digital reciept in the form of a transaction id for every transaction completed. Most wallets will provide this for you.

## Examples

Bitcoin: [c839b44a7052393f4672cdc4ec79f8f15d3036565e13bede0fab91f674506a7c](https://mempool.space/tx/c839b44a7052393f4672cdc4ec79f8f15d3036565e13bede0fab91f674506a7c)
    
    
Ethereum: [0x43117fc201f8d3c09a72d42ab4a048003f348917771b9ace64b8944a91807320](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x43117fc201f8d3c09a72d42ab4a048003f348917771b9ace64b8944a91807320)
    
 
Zcash (public): [8dd212847a97c5eb9cee5e7e58c4d9e739f4156273ae3b2da1a4ff79ad95ff82](https://zcashblockexplorer.com/transactions/8dd212847a97c5eb9cee5e7e58c4d9e739f4156273ae3b2da1a4ff79ad95ff82)
  
  
Zcash (private): [19a4be270089490ece2e5fe7a6c9b9804af3c7ed43e1fb1b744b0fb29070fa5d](https://zcashblockexplorer.com/transactions/19a4be270089490ece2e5fe7a6c9b9804af3c7ed43e1fb1b744b0fb29070fa5d)


Notice with zcash how the second transaction has all important details hidden, this is important and has great implications in a digital world.


## Blockchain Maps

So we have this long string of charactors as a digital reciept, what now? This is where we use our blockchain explorer, or map, to help us digest what happened on the blockchain. Notice how each chain as its own version of blockchain explorer above. Its important to understand that all these blockchain projects are examples of open source software. That is, anyone can contribute to and or fork the code to their liking. With that understanding, each project specializes in different areas and customizes the blockchain explorer to fit the needs of said project.

### Blocks
Transactions are placed into *blocks*. When a block is mined/validated every transaction inside that block is confirmed. You may have seen CEX's neededing a number of *confirmations* before they release your funds, this is the metric they are using to make sure your transction is 
sufficiently finalized. How does the blockchain determine which transactions get into the next block? Complex topic of research, but most modern chains use the idea of *fees* to determine who gets into the front of the line. The higher the fee, the higher the chance you move up to the front of the queue.

### Addresses

A fun way to learn blockchain explorers is to use the addresses of any random transaction on move backward in time! Unless you're using shielded Zcash, you can do this with any transparent blockchain: BTC, ETH, ATOM, DOGE, VTC, etc ... . This point is critical for using the blockchain safely moving into a digital only future.
