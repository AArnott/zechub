# ZecHub DAO

The ZecHub DAO currently consists of 8 founding members:

* @squirrel
* @yoditar.zkp 
* @gordonesroo 
* @michae2xl 
* @dismad 
* @tokidoki 
* @decentralistdan
* @janusz

The DAO will serve as an experiment for future Zcash organizations who are interested in new forms of decentralized governance models, and ZEC’s utility cross-chain.

## What is a DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

DAOs need the following elements for being fully functional: 

* A set of rules to which will operate
* A funding like tokens that the organization can spend to reward certain activities to their members
* Provide voting rights for establishing the operation rules. 
* A well and secure structure that allows every member to configure the organization.  

## What makes ZecHub unique?

ZecHub is one of the first public DAO's in Zcash's history. A unique aspect of the DAO is how its funds are held in Shielded Zcash address, compared to most DAO's that live on Ethereum. We have also created a [NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/zechub) for establishing voting rights.

The governance structure is currently being developed by the founding members and will be public once completed.
