## Where you can find community members

The community active in a number of different places:

## Telegram

The Zcash community is very active in its community telegram. This is a channel where zcashers talk about the day-to-day, discuss news and updates, and is also a good place for community members to get acquainted with each other. The link to join is [here](https://t.me/Zcash_Community).

## Discord

There are a few of [Zcash-specific discords](https://www.notion.so/zechub/Social-Media-Links-05b9df645af54de7a1989d9c4ccc4d05) where members congregate. You have the Zcash LATAM, the Zcash Community discord which is run by community members, and you have the Zcash Foundation discord, which is managed by the Zcash Foundation.

These places are great options for new community members to join in discussions. Please note that the discord conversations are more often technical conversations than not. It's a great place for developers to join in on the discussion.

*There is also a Cypherpunk Zero DAO discord, but you need a Cypherpunk Zero NFT in order to join that.*

## The Forum

The [Zcash community forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/) is a place where long form discussions related to Zcash take place. It's where members voice their support for various proposals in the community, debate specific topics, and also a place where projects seeking grants funding can go to announce their intention for applying to the Zcash Community Grants program. These are not the only topics for discussion, but they are some of the most common.

## Twitter
