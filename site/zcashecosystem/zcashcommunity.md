#### Discord

There are a couple of Zcash-specific discords where members congegreate. You have the Zcash Community discord which is run by community members, and you have the Zcash Foundation discord, which is managed by the zcash foundation.

Both places are great options for new community members to join in discussions. Please note that the discord conversations are more often technical conversations than not. It's a great place for developers to join in on the discussion.

*There is also a Cypherpunk Zero DAO discord, but you need a Cypherpunk Zero NFT in order to join that.*
