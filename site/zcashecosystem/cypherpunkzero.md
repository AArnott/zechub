# Cypherpunk Zero

Cypherpunk Zero is a story telling series centered around Zero, a young cypherpunk hacker and freedom fighter. Zero is currently living in a dystopian nightmare and she uses code to fight against the centralized gatekeepers shackling society.

The story was inspired by Zcash and Halo cryptography. The creative work is a collaborative effort between ECC, Stranger World, Might Jaxx and select ecosystem partners.

The creative work has most notably focused on an [NFT series](https://opensea.io/collection/cypherpunk-zero), but a [prologue comic](https://halo.electriccoin.co/#view-prologue) and [collectible toy](https://mightyjaxx.com/products/cypherpunk-zero) have also been released.

The NFT community, mostly active on Twitter, has even created a [decentralized organization (DAO)](https://twitter.com/TakeshiBrock/status/1542580406570164225) to organize and complete projects supporting the campaign, and the broader Zcash community.
