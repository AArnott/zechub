# Welcome to the ZecHub Free2z page! 

**Thanks for stopping by, and we hope that you'll join us in building an open-source education hub for Zcash**

### tl;dr:

- ZecHub is an open-source platform trying to onboard hundreds of individual contributors into Zcash!
- We update this Free2z page with our latest content.
- Like what we're doing? Come work with us! The project is completely open-sourced and needs contributors.

The goal of [ZecHub](http://zechub.xyz) is to provide an educational platform where community members can work together on creating, validating, and promoting content that supports the Zcash ecosystem.

We open-source our content for a few reasons. One, we want to give people the opportunity to suggest edits to content that might be incorrect, incomplete, or missing important context. Two, we want to create an environment that easily onboards people into the Zcash ecosystem. If you would like to find out more on how to contribute, join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sCT3h87B) & read how to get started [here](https://zechub.notion.site/Help-Build-ZecHub-9f4aaa45f37d438dac56025449604d96).

We are creating our Free2z page to act as a Zcash-centric page where we host the content we create. We will update it weekly :) Please consider donating!
