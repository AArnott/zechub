Welcome to the ZecHub Free2z page! Thanks for stopping by, and we hope that you'll join us in building Zcash's open-source education hub.

tl;dr:

- ZecHub is an open-source platform trying to onboard hundreds of individual contributors into Zcash!
- We update this Free2z page with our latest content.
- Like what we're doing? Come work with us! The project is completely open-sourced and needs contributors.

ZecHub is an open-source education hub for Zcash. The goal of [ZecHub](http://zechub.xyz) is to provide a educational platform where community members can work together on creating, validating, and promoting content that supports the Zcash ecosystem.

We open-source our content for a few reasons. One, we want to give people the opportunity to suggest edits to content that might be incorrect, incomplete, or missing important context. Two, we want to create an environment that easily onboards people into the Zcash ecosystem.

We're creating our Free2z page to act as a Zcash-centric page where we host the content we create. We will update it weekly :) Please consider donating!

Our latest content is below:

- The latest ZecWeekly newsletter <embed: https://zechub.substack.com/>
- The latest zl;dr, a weekly Zcash show: 
- The latest episode of our podcast: 
- Our wiki-site with tons of information on Zcash & ZEC:

Check our content, stay up to date on Zcash, and most importantly, contribute! Let us know what you want to build :)
