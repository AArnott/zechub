**INTRODUCTION**

First things first, it is worth mentioning that Zcash has become a global sensation since its debut; 2024 is shaping up to be an exceptional year for ZecHub as we hope to reach great milestones. In this article, we will discuss about Web Browsers! We basically use them almost every day. We’d also take a sneak peek at some security considerations to keep in mind while using them. So, I’ll kick things off by defining what a web browser really is.

# What Are Web Browsers?

A web browser is a special type of software application that allows people to find, view content, access, and display websites on the Internet. There are many different web browsers out there, I’ll discuss some of the top options used by individuals.

1. **BRAVE:** is one of the most prominent and safest browsers on the market today. It blocks privacy-invasive ads & trackers. It blocks third-party data storage.

3. **Microsoft Edge**: coming in hot at number 3 is Microsoft Edge, it is the default browser for all Windows 10 devices and highly compatible with the modern web - One of the most fascinating things about Microsoft Edge is that it offers the most comprehensive set of built-in learning and accessibility tools on the web and much more.

## What Are The Security Considerations When Selecting A Web Browser?

When selecting a web browser there are a few things to keep in mind: Just so you know, security vulnerabilities and exploits are usually discovered regularly so, choose a web browser that consistently receives security updates and patches. More so, when selecting that browser that you feel might suit your needs, make sure it provides robust privacy features and essential features such as built-in ad blockers and whatnot. Additionally, many of these web browsers support extensions plus add-ons, and sometimes these extensions may pose security risks, be sure to always install these extensions from a secured ecosystem or trusted sources. 

While security is a pivotal topic in the light of web browsers, it is also at the forefront of blockchain technology! Using zero-knowledge proof, the individual's wallet balance and transaction history are not displayed publicly. That's where Zcash comes in! 

 
## Brave Browser Integration

Brave browser is paving the way for the web3 ecosystem. How? More than 2 million unstoppable domains can now be leveraged for displaying decentralized websites. With Brave’s robust security feature, people can explore the internet without being tracked. Brave and Zcash are joining forces to bring new privacy tools to Web3 ecosysem. For greater benefits, Brave would integrate swiftly with Zcash protocol via Brave's built-in crypto wallet - This integration would enable users to safely store, send , and receive ZEC very easily plus other crypto currencies as well.
