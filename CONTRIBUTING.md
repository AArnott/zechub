## New contributors

To get an overview of ZecHub, read the [README](/README.md).

## Getting started

If you're new to GitHub, don't worry! We're going to break down how you can get involved as a community contributor to ZecHub. We pay out tips in ZEC for every contribution completed.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a pull request (PR), reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon ![table of contents icon dark theme](/assets/icons/contents-dark.png) ![table of contents icon light theme](/assets/icons/contents-light.png) on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## Join the conversation

First, join the conversation in the [Zcash LATAM discord](https://discord.gg/zcash). There's a ZecHub section where we chat about all things ZecHub :smile:

<small> Don’t forget to add the ZecHub role in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/978714252934258779/983468150861484093">#lang-menu channel</a>! </small>

## Ways you can contribute

ZecHub is broken down into a few parts. Let's review how you can get involved:

### Newsletter - 0.5 ZEC per edition

We produce the ecosystem's weekly newsletter. This is a super low lift / easy way to get involved! The newsletter goes out every Friday or Saturday. If you want to write a newsletter, message @janusz or @squirrel in the #zecweekly section of the Discord to let them know.

After you do that, you can go to the [newsletter section of this repository](/newsletter/newsletterbasics.md) and submit a pull-request to create a new edition of the newsletter. Please follow the format used in this [template](/newsletter/newslettertemplate.md).

After you do this @janusz or @squirell (in Discord) will see that your new edition of the newsletter available, and they'll review and then merge it to the repository. After it's been merged, they'll take the content and post it via Substack.

After you submit the PR, please make sure you comment your unified address (UA) so we can send you a tip!

### Translating Newsletter - 0.2 ZEC per translation

We'd love for you to contribute the next edition of the ZecWeekly newsletter, or translate the content into other languages! We currently have editions in Spanish, Portuguese and Russian. The translated versions are posted on their socials, and we do our best to amplify them via the ZecHub social.

If you want to translate the newsletter into your local language, we send tips for that too. Let us know what channel you would share it from and the language you would publish the newsletter in, so we can coordinate its release.

### ZecHub Wiki - 1 ZEC per new page published

We have a wiki-docs page that aims to provide Zcash education materials in an easy and digestible format. Zcash is a very advanced technology and virbrant community, so there's a lot more documentation we need to build. We aim to build documentation on:

- Zcash Tech
- ZEC (Zcash currency) use cases
- New user guides
- Zcash community and ecosystem
- Docs in other languages

These are pretty broad areas, so there's a lot to work from. If you want some inspiration, check out our current [wiki-docs site](https://zechub.notion.site/zechub/ZecHub-Wiki-d74acc14d9c04887be52486db86da0ba) and see what's missing. Once you determine what you want to write, [start to make your changes](#make-changes) to learn how to submit a PR to the ZecHub repo. All of our docs are created and maintained in this repo. Please use this [template](https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/template.md) when building out docs.

After you submit a PR, please message @dismad in the #zecwiki section of the discord, and he will review your PR and merge if it is ready to be added to the site. If merged, he will add the doc to the ZecHub website. If the doc is not ready, he will suggest edits for you in the PR.

Please comment your z-addr in the PR so we can send you a tip!

### ZecHub Wiki - 0.1 ZEC per accepted edit to docs

Sometimes our information in the docs isn't spot on. That's okay. That's why we open-source them! If you find something that needs a change in a wiki-doc, please go to the footer of the doc (which links to its Github page) and suggest a change via a PR.

Please comment your z-addr in the PR so we can send you a tip!

### ZecHub Wiki - 0.05 ZEC per broken link fixed or spelling error corrected

If you find that a link is broken, or something is mispelled, please go to the footer of the doc (which links to its Github page) and suggest the change via a PR.

Please comment your z-addr in the PR so we can send you a small tip for finding the error.

### Video content - 2.5 ZEC per video and/or audio posted on ZecHub socials

ZecHub has expirmented with video content in the past, mainly a [weekly news show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frTzwCWRNLs&t=434s). Those efforts are currently on pause, so there's an opportunity here! If you have an idea for a weekly news show, short-form podcast, Twitter spaces series, or any another video/audio content piece, let us know in the #video-content channel in Discord and we'll discuss. 

These bounties are a bit larger, and we'd hope for some consistency with this type of content (minimum five content pieces created), so a proposal would need to be submitted to ZecHub's DAO before approving the spend. That process usually takes a week.

Potentially 12.5 ZEC for anyone with ideas here! We have budget for funding video content series at this moment in time. If you have an idea, join the conversation in the #video-content channel in our Discord so we can get moving on it :)

### Zcash Tutorials (with audio) - up to 1.5 ZEC per tutorial

We sometimes release tutorials on how to use Zcash-related apps. Here's an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgm_nK3gr7U&list=PL6_epn0lASLGc_YALzxbMH0-dNyhFufus&index=7) of one of the tutorials. There's always room for doing more of these, and we also need tutorials in other languages.

The best way to do this is to either 1) submit a PR to the zechub/tutorials section of the ZecHub repo or 2) send the tutorial video to the #video-content channel in the ZecHub section of the Discord.

If the video meets our content moderation standards, we'll post it to our socials and send you a tip :) Please send your z-addr to the #video-content channel so we can send you the tip.

### Creative content for social - up to .75 ZEC per creative posted on ZecHub socials

Something we haven't expiremented with is creative pieces for our social media! Think creating a TikTok like video with a quote from ZecHub's podcast, Zcash GIFs, or a really solid Zcash meme. We also need thumbnails for our newsletter and Podcast, so there's an opportunity to build those as well.

If you've got design chops, let us know in the #design channel in the ZecHub section of the Discord. Once the piece is complete, you can send us your UA in the #design channel so we can send you a tip.

### Other ideas? Let us know!

If you believe there's a way that you could add value to ZecHub, and it's not listed above, please let us know in the #general channel in the ZecHub channel of the Discord. We can disucss your idea, and if there's a need, we can create a proposal for ZecHub's DAO to see if it can get funding.

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/zechub/zechub/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an issue
