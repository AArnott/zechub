The goal of ZecHub is to provide a educational platform where community members can work together on creating, validating, and promoting content that supports the Zcash ecosystem. We do this through a few mechanisms.

  1. [Tutorials. Primarily videos explaining how to use ZEC.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3-KM00kjCUheRzO5cq3PAA)
  2. [Wiki-docs. Short ZEC content for beginners.](https://wiki.zechub.xyz)
  3. [A podcast interviewing community members.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_epn0lASLHlNCMtUErX8UfaJK6N9K5O)
  4. [A weekly Zcash newsletter.](https://zechub.substack.com/)
  
The tutorials, short articles, and newsletter will be open sourced and hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone from the community to contribute. This ensures content is accurate and avoids single points of failure.
