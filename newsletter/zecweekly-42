## This Week's Education Piece 
In this week's education piece, we'll be looking at a protocol which helps to create hard to trace communication by making use of chains of multiple servers known as "Mixes". The Mixes receives data or information from multiple senders, it then shuffles the received data and send them back in random order to  another mix node which makes the transaction difficult to trace the communication. 

Learn more about this method of blockchain privacy via ZecHub Zero to Zero Knowledge tutorial session ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
