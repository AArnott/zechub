#### Welcome to ZecWeekly

Hey everyone! So, I decided to start a weekly newsletter that eventually is managed by multiple community members. This newsletter covers the week of July 11th. This is an expirement to decentralize Zcash marketing efforts, and increase a "guerilla" community marketing strategy into the ecosystem. This is a part of a broader project, and it's been so much fun to build so far. Really enjoying the bear.

Enjoy!

-Ian
