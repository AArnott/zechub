#### Welcome to ZecWeekly

Hey everyone! VEGAS!!! Super excited to meet some of you at Zcon3. I'm heading out to Vegas in a few hours, and wanted to get this newsletter out before I head to the airport. Here's some links that highlight all things Zcash from the past week.

See you all by the (shielded) pool. Cheers!
