## This week's education piece

[Cypherpunk Underground](https://twitter.com/Cypherpunk_Anon) returns in Chapter 12 - Mobile Phone Pinging

The page explores the concept of cell phone "pinging", how its done & used by governments and law enforcement, and also what it means for citizens. To introduce this is a video with Edward Snowden. Some further reading is provided in the form of internal fbi documentation on what might be one of the more complex and interesting topics in the underground series! 
In closing it's clarified that the information is meant to serve as a good first step in understanding the methods & tools in use.
