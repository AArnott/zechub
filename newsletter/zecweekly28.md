## This week's education piece

ZKP & zk-SNARKS on ZecHub Wiki

The technology that allows Zcash to be the best implementation of private value storage. In this Zcash Wiki page we learn the basics on what Zero Knowledge proofs & zk-SNARKS are starting with the question "What are proofs?" 

We then move on to get examples of Interactive Proofs and how they allow a 'blind' verifier to gain certainty of a provers claim. 

Next are descriptions of the elements in SNARKS, the different types preprocessing & proof constructions and how they are implemented in Zcash and other applications like zkRollups and even image verification. 

Check it out [here](https://zechub.notion.site/ZKP-ZK-SNARKS-70944da7b89e479c8f763edea5d16d65)
