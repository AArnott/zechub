## This Week's Education Piece 
In this week education piece, we'll be looking at an anonymous strategy utilized by Bitcoin to protect user privacy whenever transaction is being conducted by users on the Bitcoin Blockchain. The process of transaction anonymity existing between users on the Bitcoin network is known as CoinJoin. This strategy sometimes requires multiple parties to jointly sign a digital smart contract to mix their coins in a new Bitcoin transaction. 

You can learn more about CoinJoin via the below tutorial link created by ZecHub Zero to Zero Knowledge Weekly Tutorial;
