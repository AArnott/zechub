###Welcome to ZecWeekly Episode 81


Hey, glad to welcome to another exciting edition of ZecWeekly! We've got fresh updates and updated features. Let's walk through recent news and events in the Zcash community together.


Zcash continues to scale new heights, reaching different milestones. From Frost Update, an  era of unmatched privacy, great Zcash content from free2Z,Ywallet features, how Frost Technology will allow custodial  exchanges store ZEC on non-public addresses, and major proposals in Zcash and ECC Update as well.


###This Week's Education Pieces.


It's a great time to learn how to add Zcash Donation to your website and here is an educational video to vividly explain the steps of setting up the widget and how it works. 



This video is a tutorial on how to configure a Zcash donation widget on your website. The donation widget follows the implementation of Zcash Improvement Proposal 321 (ZIP 321).  ZIP 321 is a way to encode payment information into a UI that can be easily shared and used by wallet software.


It further demonstrates how to use a donation widget that creates a payment request URL. This URL contains the address of the Zcash wallet you want to receive the payment to, the amount of money you want to receive, and possibly other details such as a label or a memo of the transaction.
