## This week's education piece

Viualizing Addresses - ZecHub

This week @Dismad8 presents a guide for newcomers to the Zcash ecosystem. Different address types can be confusing, its an uncommon feature in other cryptocurrencies.

The guide runs through what each Address Type looks like such as, Transaparent addresses starting with a 't' & their character lengths. We then learn about Unified Addresses and how they allow both transparent and shielded transactions to be received to your wallet using the same address!

Definitely useful page anyone new to Zcash Wallets. Read [here](https://zechub.notion.site/Visualizing-Zcash-Addresses-27c0bcc423fa48f68374a0d6c317213b)
