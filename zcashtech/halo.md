# Halo

Halo, if youâ€™re not familiar, is a trustless, recursive zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) discovered by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Co. and was implemented in Zcash earlier this year. It eliminates the trusted setup and allows greater scalability.

This document will go over Halo at a high level and provide references to documentation that dives deeper into the zero-knowledge proof.

Tl;dr

- Halo is a trustless, recursive zeroknowledge proof
- It went live into Zcash mainnet with NU5, eliminating Zcash's dependency on zk-SNARKS that required a trusted setup ceremony
- Other projects are using Halo for a variety of different reasons, from privacy to scalability

## What is Halo

As mentioned above, Halo is a trustless, recursive zero-knowledge proof. What does that mean?
