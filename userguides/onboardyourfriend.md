So your friend sent you to this article? I’m sorry man.
But, let’s get you some Zcash.

What’s Zcash? It’s this new type of money that’s completely digital. Maybe you’ve heard about it. Maybe you’ve bought some!

I call it digital cash. That's because you don't need a bank account, and can be from anywhere, to send and receive Zcash.

So, have you ever done a Zcash transaction?

No? Let’s get rolling then.
Download a wallet

The first thing you’re going to do is download Ywallet. Here’s a super simple tutorial on how to do that.

Tl;dr? Search for “Ywallet” on your App Store. Download it.

It’s downloaded? Great.
The app

Let’s mess about with the app really quick. There’s a few options. Send, receive, settings… kind of like Venmo right?

Exactly. This is Venmo for magic internet money. Ywallet is a Zcash wallet that helps you send and receive money, from anywhere in the world, instantly.

Let’s test it out!

You see that QR code with a copy button? That’s your Zcash address.

Copy that address and send it to your friend. If you have no friends, send it to me on Twitter.

We’ll be able to send you some zats (Zcash “cents”).

So you’ve got the zats now, right?

Dope. Let’s send a transaction. This is the magical part.

We need to find someone to send some sats to. You could send them to your friend... but that's not any fun, is it?

There’s this cool crowdfunding project on Zcash. It’s called Free2z.

Free2z helps fund indepedent Zcash projects. Zcash has a growing grassroots movement, and a lot of projects rely on donations.

Let's send someone some zats!
Sending zats

ZecHub is a community news source that provides news and education on Zcash. I think it's pretty dope (disclaimer, I created it).

Let's show them some love. First, we go to their Free2z page. Then, in the right bottomhand corner, you can see fund project. Click that.

You'll see ZecHub's Zcash address. Copy that.

Now let's go back to your wallet. In the home screen in Ywallet, there's a send button in the bottom righthand corner. Click that.

The wallet will then pull up it's send screen. In the "Send ZEC to..." section, you can paste ZecHub's address. Then, type in 0.001 ZEC to send to ZecHub.

Then scroll down to the bottom, and click send. Ywallet will take you to a screen that shows how good your privacy score is for this transaction.

It says good? Then we're good to go.

Click send :)

That's it!
Don't stop here

You just sent a global payment without using an ID or signing up for a service.
